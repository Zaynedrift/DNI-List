# DNI LIST
This is a list of people who I would not like to interact with on the internet and will avoid. 

[dni.zaynedrift.com](https://dni.zaynedrift.com)

## The List Itself
People who ask about private things
(such as biological traits, personal information, etc)

Hateful People
(nazis, racists, homophobes, transphobes, etc)

TERFs / Trans-Exclusionary Radical "Feminists"
(these "feminists" are transphobic,
if you're a terf, I hope you get tortured to death <333)

Child Touchers
(fucking disgusting, MAPs aren't valid and never will be,
also "Game is game" is disgusting)

RCTA
(racist and transphobic, also makes no sense, not valid)

-13 or +35
(too young or old for me to be comfortable talking to online)

Belief Forcers
(I respect Religion and Belief, not forcing it onto someone)

Too Egotistical for their own good
(tbh it's just annoying as hell)

Liars, Cheaters & Manipulators
(I can tell when you're trying to gaslight or manipulate me,
or if you're lying, fuck off.)
